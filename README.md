# PRODIGY_CS_02
This project is the second task for the Prodigy InfoTech Python Programming Internship. It involves developing a simple image inscription tool using pixel-level manipulation techniques. The main objective is to create a Python program that can inscript (encrypt) and descript (decrypt) images by modifying pixel values in a controlled way. This can include operations such as swapping pixel values or applying basic mathematical functions (e.g., addition, subtraction, modulo) to each pixel in the image. Users can load an image, enter a custom key or instruction, and the tool will transform the pixel data accordingly. The same logic, when reversed, allows the original image to be restored. The program is built using Python libraries such as Pillow (PIL) for image processing and NumPy for efficient array manipulation. This task provides a foundational understanding of how images are represented as pixel matrices and how simple transformations can be used for data hiding or visual encryption. The focus is on interactivity, accuracy, and reversibility of the transformation process.
